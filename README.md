# OpenATS

To run the script, follow these steps:

Open a text editor and copy the entire code into a new file.

Save the file with a .py extension, for example, Openats.py.

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where you saved the script using the cd command. For example, if the script is saved in the Documents directory, use the command cd Documents to navigate to that directory.

Once you're in the correct directory, run the script using the command python ats_similarity.py.

The script will prompt you to enter the full path of your resume file. Provide the path and press Enter.

Next, it will ask for the full path of the job description file. Enter the path and press Enter.

The script will calculate the similarity score and display it as a percentage.

Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system and the required packages (os and difflib) installed as well.

############### IF you have Kali installed in your system ##############

You can check the installed version of Python by running the command python3 --version in a terminal.

If Python 3 is not installed, you can install it using the package manager apt. Run the following commands in a terminal to install Python 3:

sudo apt update

sudo apt install python3

Once Python 3 is installed, you can proceed with running the script as described earlier.

########### IF you have Jupyter Notebook ########################

Open Jupyter Notebook by running the command jupyter notebook in your terminal.

This will open a web browser with the Jupyter Notebook interface.

Navigate to the directory where you want to create a new notebook or open an existing notebook.

Click on "New" and select "Python 3" to create a new Python notebook.

In the first cell of the notebook, copy and paste the script code.

Modify the code as needed, such as specifying the file paths directly instead of prompting for user input.

Run the cell by clicking on the "Run" button or by using the Shift+Enter keyboard shortcut.

The output will be displayed below the cell, showing the similarity score as a percentage.

Using Jupyter Notebook allows you to execute the script and view the output within a notebook interface. You can also make use of additional Jupyter Notebook features such as markdown cells for documentation and further analysis.

Remember to install any required dependencies, such as the difflib package, before running the script in the notebook
